# The population RNA-seq analyses are divided by:# Core analysis - DESeq analysis of the transcriptomic datasets, providing normalized expression data and differential gene expression analysis# Essentials - contains the necessary data to perform the analyses, including read counts (HTseq), pathway terms, and R functions# Figures - Provides the R scripts for generating the figures related to the transcriptomic data# Tables - Provides the R scripts for generating the tables related to the transcriptomic data
