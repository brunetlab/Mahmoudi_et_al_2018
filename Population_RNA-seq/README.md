# The population RNA-seq analyses are divided by:- **Essentials** - contains the necessary data to perform the analyses, including read counts (HTseq), pathway terms, and R functions.- **Core analysis** - DESeq2 analyses of the transcriptomic datasets, providing normalized expression data and differential gene expression analysis.- **Figures** - Provides the R scripts for generating the figures related to the transcriptomic data.- **Tables** - Provides the R scripts for generating the tables related to the transcriptomic data.
