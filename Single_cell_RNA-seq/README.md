# The single cell RNA-seq analysis is divided by:


- **in vivo single cell RNA-seq**
	- **PAGODA** - Provides the data and R scripts for generating the figures related to the PAGODA analysis of the in vivo single cell RNA-								 seq data. 
	- **Seurat** - Provides the data and R scripts for generating the figures related to the Seurat analysis of the in vivo single cell RNA-								 seq data. 

- **in vitro single cell RNA-seq**
	- **PAGODA** - Provides the data and R scripts for generating the figures related to the PAGODA analysis of the in vitro single cell
								 RNA-seq data.
	- **tSNE** - Provides the data and R scripts for tSNE analysis.
